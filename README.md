# CorrelatedVariants

This package was extracted from SMRTAnalysis 2.3.0. It is (as far as I can
tell) part of the backend for the SMRTAnalysis Minor Variants protocol.

# Dependencies

Dependencies can be found among [Pacific Biosciences' repositories](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences) or via Debian's stable-backports (pbcore and
GenomicConsensus are packaged as python-pbcore and pbgenomicconsensus).
